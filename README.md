## Please note: Due to Render's free-tier limitations, the server may return a 502 error if accessed after long inactivity. If so, kindly wait up to 1–2 minutes and refresh — the app should respond once fully reactivated.
**Important Note:** The deployed link may be sleeping on the Render platform. Please allow up to 5 minutes for the server to "wake up" and become fully operational when the link is accessed.


# 🧠 Semantic Text Similarity API 
Deployed Link on Render : [https://similaritytextscorerender.onrender.com/](https://similaritytextscorerender.onrender.com/)

A lightweight Flask-based REST API that computes the **semantic similarity** between two text inputs using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model (`paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2`). 

This API returns a score between `0` and `1`, where:
- `1.0` means the texts are **highly similar**
- `0.0` means the texts are **completely different**
